# Experiment-10
# Aim of Experiment: Study of Pandas library.
# Theory:
- import pandas as pd → Used to import the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.  
- pd.Series() → Used to create a Series, which stores one-dimensional labeled data.  
- pd.DataFrame() → Used to create a DataFrame, which stores data in tabular (row–column) form.  
- print() → Used to display the Series and DataFrame output.  
- .shape → Used to find the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.  
- .ndim → Used to find the number of dimensions of the DataFrame.  
- .size → Used to find the total number of elements in the DataFrame.  
- .columns → Used to display the column names of the DataFrame.  
- .dtypes → Used to check the data type of each column.  
- df['column_name'] → Used to access a specific column from the DataFrame.  
- .loc[] → Used to access data using row labels and column names.  
- .iloc[] → Used to access data using row and column positions.  
- df['new_column'] = values → Used to add a new column to the DataFrame.  
- df.at[] / df.loc[] = value → Used to update specific values in the DataFrame.  
- df.drop() → Used to delete unwanted columns from the DataFrame.   
- .mean(), .min(), .max() → Used to perform basic statistical operations on numerical data.  
- df[condition] → Used to filter data based on a given condition.
# Conclusion:
Thus, the experiment successfully demonstrates the use of Pandas commands to create, access, modify, and analyze data using Series and DataFrame,   
helping in efficient data handling and basic data analysis.
